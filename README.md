AsyncSockets
============

Playing around with System.Net.Sockets library, still missing the client but this server
should allow multiple clients to hook up and transmit simple raw data to the server, 
this ofc can be upgraded to use defined data packets, implement serialization, tls, bidirectional
communications or w.e is on your mind.
