AsyncSockets
============

Playing around with System.Net.Sockets library, this server allows multiple clients to hook up and
transmit simple raw data to the server, this ofc can be upgraded to use defined data packets, 
implement serialization, tls, bidirectional communications or w.e is on your mind.
